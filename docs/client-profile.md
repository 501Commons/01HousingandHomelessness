# Client Profile Builder flow

There is a flow/flow template called **Client Profile**. It makes some basic assumptions

1. You are capturing client information on Contat
2. You are using the Other Address to store their physical address
3. You are not saving the employment/housing information in your org

This is implemented as a flow so that you can easily customize it. For example, you can modify the flow to

1. Save the housing/employment information into a field in your org
2. Grab address and DOB information from something besides the standard contact fields, or from other objects
