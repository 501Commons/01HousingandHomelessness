# Permissions Setup

## Permission Set

The package includes a permission set called **RefRecAdmin**.

Add this for any user who needs full admin access the package objects.

## Testing Beta Packages

There's an apex script that automates some CMDT updates. Beta packages require you to allow this.

- Setup > Apex Settings
- Check the box that says **Deploy Metadata from Non-Certified Package Versions via Apex**
