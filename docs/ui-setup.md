# UI Setup

Make sure that your org has myDomain activated so you can use the custom Lightning Component

The app ReferralRecommendations has the component already on the page. In real life, you probably have a contact page you use in other apps. You can add the components to it.

1. Open your contact page in AppBuilder
2. Drag the custom component onto the page
3. Drag a flow component onto the page and set it to the flow called "Client Profile Builder" and pass in the contactID as the recordId for the flow using the checkbox.
4. If you don't have it already, add the Birthdate to the Contact Page Layout
